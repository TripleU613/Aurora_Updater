Simplified Aurora Store fork focused on app updates only.

## Features
- **Updates only** - Clean interface focused solely on updating existing apps
- **Anonymous login** - Spoof Manager as fallback for authentication
- **Password protection** - Secure Blacklist Manager with alphanumeric password support
- **No Google Play browsing** - External Google Play links disabled to prevent app discovery
- **Root install selected by default** - Will check on first launch. If no root, fallback to session installer
